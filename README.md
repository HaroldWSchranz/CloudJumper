# CloudJumper
Join Cloud Jumper, a sacred fox in-training, and his gluttonous, spritely companion, Kit, as they race through the sky in practice for the day that Cloud Jumper is called to the heavens to fulfil his dreams of becoming a messenger of the gods.

Remember to move .gitignore to the same directory as the Assets folder for the Unity build.
